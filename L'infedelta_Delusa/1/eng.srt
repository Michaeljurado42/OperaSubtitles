1
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Beautiful evening and gracious breezes

2
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that erase from the day

3
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
excessive and great heat

4
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Blow even more calmly,

5
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
grant our wishes

6
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Cheer our hearts

7
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And sir, do we understand each other?

8
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes sir, everything understood

9
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's no need to speak anymore

10
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He leaves without saying goodbye...

11
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Where could my beloved be?

12
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm starting to suspect

13
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Heaven conspires to my design

14
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Beautiful prospect, I'm committed with good judgment to its triumph

15
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Ah father, being such to me, you love me

16
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Come on, tell me the rest for goodness sake

17
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,000
It's my time

18
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's my time and there's nothing more to be done

19
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ah father, Ah father

20
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Speak I beg you

21
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,000
Now, my daughter, it's best to stay silent

22
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Secret discussions dont always remain so

23
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Do you understand, do you get my meaning?

24
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I dare not speak

25
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Now, my daughter, it's best to stay silent, I dare not speak

26
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You get my meaning, I dare not speak

27
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Truly, it would be a great incivility

28
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
to deprive you of comfort and freedom

29
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let's go, brother, let's go

30
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Let's go sister, to dine for now

31
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Each one keeps their agreement, everyone

32
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We may see each other with the passing of time

33
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We can happily converse among ourselves

34
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes, daughter, in the end I've found you a husband

35
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And when?

36
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Now, the deal is concluded

37
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
With Nanni?

38
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, Nanni indeed! He can wipe that drool off his chin

39
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This time, he won't get any

40
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But...

41
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There aren't many 'buts', my daughter, Nanni is poor

42
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I who am rich?

43
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You will be

44
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What does it matter if I'll be rich, if I won't be happy?

45
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
And why not?

46
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Because I love him

47
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,400
You make me laugh. Now, you'll love this one

48
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:06,400
But how can one love another, when one turns from their beloved?

49
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Easily, girls don't have a will of their own

50
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,000
But when it comes from within, what can be done?

51
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,600
One obeys and stays silent

52
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:24,200
But what should I do, if Nanni comes with such charm?

53
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Turn your back to him, and walk away

54
00:29:49,200 --> 00:30:08,200
When he comes to make love, you must always tell him no

55
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,200
Do you care for me?

56
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,200
No, sir

57
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Sir, no

58
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Do you want to marry me?

59
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,700
Sir, no

60
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,320
I know well what I'm doing

61
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,000
I'm your father,

62
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
and this is my wish

63
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,900
Beware of saying yes to him

64
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Poor me! Poor Nanni!

65
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:37,000
How can I keep saying no to him when I always want to say yes?

66
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
He cares for me so much!

67
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,000
We've been bonded in love for so long,

68
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
and to leave him like this...

69
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,000
breaks my heart

70
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Yet, I must obey and so perish

71
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
For Heaven's sake!

72
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,000
There he is; it might be better if I leave

73
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Where are you going, Sandrina?

74
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,500
I don't even know myself

75
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Are you perchance angry?

76
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
No!

77
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
But, you seem troubled

78
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Your eyes are red

79
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You look like you've been crying

80
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Tell me, dear, what happened?

81
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Nothing

82
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
But why won't you look at me?

83
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,900
Why won't you speak to me?

84
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,900
Because... no

85
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,500
What? What have I done?

86
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
I don't know...

87
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Poor me! What does this mean?

88
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Is it that you do not care for me anymore? That you share no more love for me?

89
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,500
(And yet I must say it) No, sir

90
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,500
What? Am I not the one you've loved until now, the one who loved you faithfully?

91
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
The one who was to marry you?

92
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
No, sir

93
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,000
You speak to me this way, and yet you cry?

94
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,500
Black soul! Deceitful, wicked girl, you wish for my downfall, you desire my death

95
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You'll be pleased. I'll go drown myself in some ditch

96
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
or from some cliff, I'll go and break my neck

97
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,000
With such a thorn in my heart, I can't go on living

98
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,560
Ah no, sir!

99
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,560
But why do you hold me back? What do you care about me?

100
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,000
You don't send me away? Does this heart not betray me?

101
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,560
You won't leave me, cruel one?

102
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,560
No, sir

103
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm going mad. Who taught you such an air?

104
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,000
(Truly, it's better if I go away.)

105
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,000
You're leaving?

106
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,600
No

107
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,000
Are you driving me away? Should I leave you?

108
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,700
No

109
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,400
Are you disgusted?

110
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,400
No

111
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,000
Cursed 'no'!

112
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
(I'm desperate.)

113
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But speak, but talk, finally decide

114
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Do you love me or not? Should I leave or stay?

115
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Am I to be your husband or not?

116
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
What a tangled web this is!

117
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do?

118
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:55,000
My hostile father scolds and threatens me if I speak of loving you, if I say yes

119
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:09,000
He commands and tells me he found a husband, that I mustn't oppose, that it's a better match

120
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I must leave you; I can't speak to you

121
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I mustn't oppose

122
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
No, I mustn't...

123
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:00,000
What a tangled web this is!

124
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I must leave you; I can't speak to you

125
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:14,000
And I'm dying of distress. Is this enough for you?

126
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,180
Now I understand what is going on

127
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:43,180
That baboon, that raging old sorcerer, has orchestrated this farce at my expense

128
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:53,180
But I'll see for myself. I want to know who dares to take the bread from my mouth

129
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:04,180
Sandra is mine. Without her, I couldn't live

130
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,060
Poor Nanni!

131
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:13,000
It's been more than three years that I've been courting her

132
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Every day, I bring her fruits or a small bouquet

133
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:28,000
And every night, I serenade her under her window with my little guitar

134
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:35,060
Is another dandy, who besides is unknown to me,

135
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,060
coming to mess up my plans?

136
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:44,580
I want to go to her father, I want to know who he is

137
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,580
I want him to tell me everything, from A to Z

138
00:38:49,660 --> 00:39:01,660
And once he's revealed the whole mystery to me, one of us is bound for the cemetery

139
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:31,580
There's no remedy, no compensation

140
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,580
I feel a gnawing when I think of it

141
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,580
I'm all bile, all poison

142
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:44,580
My insides burn, my chest is on fire

143
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Before losing her, I'd rather die

144
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,420
That old coot, that sorcerer,

145
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,420
who is nothing but bones and skin,

146
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:54,420
will regret it, and will swing for it

147
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:15,660
Here's my dinner ready: spring water, a bit of salad, and Moroccan bread

148
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:18,660
It's a meal fit for a king

149
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,300
But kings don't have to make their meals tasty

150
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,300
the salsa of fasting and labor

151
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,740
Goodness! It's already night,
and Nencio hasn't come yet

152
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:43,740
I wouldn't want the devil to stick in his hoof and lead him astray

153
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:49,220
He hasn't shown up all day

154
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:59,220
Tonight, I noticed him all troubled and flustered, responding with stammers, and grimacing

155
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:04,580
Why am I so poor?

156
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,000
Why is he rich and has some stake under the sun?

157
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Everyone envies me, everyone wants him

158
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,000
If he had nothing, I'd have no rivals, and I'd be happier

159
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,700
But I hear someone. Here he is

160
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,060
Ah, it's not him...

161
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,060
It's my Nanni, returning distraught and weary

162
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,000
What the devil is happening?

163
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,080
I'm desperate

164
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,780
I have a demon in my hair

165
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,780
I want to jump off a cliff

166
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,780
Speak. What is it, brother?

167
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:03,780
Ah, you make me tremble!

168
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,780
What has happened?

169
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:08,780
Speak, what is it, brother?

170
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,780
N: I'm ruined
V: How? Why?

171
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,780
My Sandrina is not for me

172
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,780
Who has slighted you such?

173
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,780
Your Nencio is taking her from me

174
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,780
My Nencio? Really?

175
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Oh what anger, oh what torment!

176
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I feel my heart pounding,

177
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:40,060
It cannot end like this

178
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,500
And where is that traitor?

179
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:30,000
With Sandrina, making love

180
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
With Sandrina? Speak, speak!

181
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
That traitor...

182
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,980
Ah, you make me tremble

183
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:10,300
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
let's go find them

184
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:38,140
I want to tear out his heart,
I want to gut him

185
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,780
[Applause]

186
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,380
[Music]

187
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,140
What will you do with so much clothes on,

188
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:29,640
It looks like you've raided a Haberdashery?

189
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:35,580
Oh brother, last night I did not act as you did,

190
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:39,000
who made such a ruckus,

191
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:43,000
And then slept soundly like a rock

192
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,300
I haven't slept a wink

193
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:50,000
And before dawn, I wandered hither and thither,

194
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and have made it so that, unless the devil intervenes,

195
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,100
I hope to thwart the wedding

196
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:03,100
Well, you know, the early bird catches the worm

197
01:04:03,100 --> 01:04:07,100
Anyway, you're a remarkable woman if you succeed

198
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:12,000
Do you think Filippa might recognize me?

199
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Not in the slightest

200
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Does this fit me well?

201
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:22,500
Enchantingly, in these clothes you look just like an eighty-year-old woman

202
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
And with the other outfit?

203
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,520
In that one, well...

204
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:35,900
Trying to turn a woman into a man seems a bit ridiculous to me,

205
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:41,000
And you might lack some... appendages

206
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,440
Quiet, I hear people. It's time

207
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:48,440
Be careful. Retreat!

208
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,440
Right Away

209
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,440
Now for the moment of truth

210
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,440
Hurry up

211
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,200
I'm coming, where are we going?

212
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,200
To the judge to file a complaint against that scoundrel Nanni

213
01:05:01,900 --> 01:05:04,200
Oh, dear father...

214
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,200
All aflutter, you'll soon see,

215
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,200
that if the notary wishes to examine me,

216
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:14,200
I'll start shaking like a leaf

217
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:19,200
Shake, quiver, crumble,
You've got to go

218
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:22,920
Pray, sir, may I inquire,

219
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,920
is a certain Nencio the lout residing here?

220
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,400
No, sister

221
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,600
Alas, just my luck!

222
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,800
I must have taken the wrong path

223
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,600
I've been walking for four hours, sir,

224
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:46,360
searching, asking, inquiring, questioning, and I can't find him...

225
01:05:46,700 --> 01:05:50,120
I believe I've traversed the whole plain

226
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:53,560
I'll show you the way; he's not far

227
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,040
Ah, so weary, and at this age,

228
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:59,040
unfortunately, it will be far the same

229
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,940
There it is

230
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:03,400
May heaven reward you

231
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh brother, you're a lifesaver

232
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:15,140
If you only knew the trouble I'm in because of that man...

233
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:22,000
"But, one must swallow and remain silent" says the proverb

234
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,780
and "those without judgment better have good legs."

235
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:31,480
What business do you have with him?

236
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:36,100
Of that I can't speak, I must remain silent and bite my tongue

237
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:40,720
S: Poor soul!
F: (She piques my curiosity greatly.)

238
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:46,400
You can speak freely with me

239
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,400
(That is the husband)

240
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,200
What do you say?!

241
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,800
Oh, nothing

242
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:57,300
"Once spoken, words don’t return to the mouth," says the proverb

243
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:01,300
"and he who doesn’t know how to stay silent doesn’t know how to live," I know

244
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:05,120
I'm not a gossip, except of good recipes!

245
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:09,880
But those with great troubles, make a loud cry

246
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:15,020
Speak on, there's no risk in venting to me

247
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:22,620
I tear up when I think of it

248
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,460
Poor dear daughter!

249
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:27,740
Poor creatures!

250
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,700
You still have, from what I see, a daughter:

251
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,940
May heaven preserve her for you

252
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:42,860
She is tall and beautiful, modest, and domestic

253
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,720
Open your eyes, poor wretched woman

254
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:51,420
Don't drown here like I have done

255
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,380
She was just like you, my dear girl,

256
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:58,800
Wise and beautiful, and throughout the neighborhood

257
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:04,040
everyone marvelled at her so much, it was pure joy

258
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,500
"As long as you have teeth in your mouth, you don't know what's in store for you,"

259
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:11,940
says the proverb

260
01:08:12,620 --> 01:08:17,000
"Those who do nothing make no mistakes, but the truth always floats to the surface,"

261
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,220
And what happened to her?

262
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,260
This Nencio, on Carnival, came to Peregola

263
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:27,820
He saw her and became infatuated

264
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:32,240
Everyone said he was such a good match

265
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:34,500
and the girl let herself be charmed

266
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:41,420
The fire ignited, and the devil fiercely fanned the flames,

267
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,000
that they secretly wed in haste

268
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:50,050
(Nencio married! Oh, the rascal!)

269
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:53,060
For a while, he played the good husband

270
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:57,990
Gradually, he grew distant, until he completely pulled away

271
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:05,120
Now, brother, it's been three days since he's shown himself,

272
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,200
and he's left her without bread, without meat,

273
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:16,500
alone in bed with two children in the cradle, and one at her breast

274
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:22,200
S: My God, what a scoundrel! And you wanted...
F: Quiet!

275
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:28,700
Just imagine how she manages nursing that poor child

276
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:38,400
"The barrel gives the wine it has," says the proverb

277
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,400
"To feed on anger is to drink of poison,"

278
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,000
sleep eludes, even with poppy's aid,

279
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
when filled with such deep sorrow and quiet pain

280
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:49,540
Oh, what a scoundrel!

281
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,820
You should seek justice, madam

282
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:56,800
I hope to bring him around, if possible, through reason

283
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,860
This rogue deserves no mercy

284
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:05,160
Ah, brother, legal disputes and courts are not for me

285
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,300
"Money and friendship break justice's neck,"

286
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,300
says the proverb...

287
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:18,240
"and he who dosen't 'grease the weal' is always wrong."

288
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:27,660
And then there are hearings, mandates, appeals, citations, contradictions, examinations, and witnesses

289
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:34,000
My dear brother, it never ends...

290
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:42,800
And I am old, and full of woes

291
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:32,180
I have a tumor in my knee
that forces me to limp

292
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:51,960
I have a fistula in this eye
that always makes me tear up

293
01:11:51,960 --> 01:12:01,000
I have a cough that's killing me,

294
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:15,300
And I struggle to breathe

295
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:36,900
That poor girl...

296
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:44,920
She's on the verge of fading away

297
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:54,800
Ah, what will become of me?

298
01:12:55,100 --> 01:13:11,110
If on top of so many woes, I had to face litigation

299
01:13:49,460 --> 01:14:03,460
I have a tumor in my knee
that forces me to limp

300
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,900
Che ne dite ?
What do you think?

301
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,900
Ah, my child, I've nearly lost my mind

302
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:19,000
If Nencio has a wife, he can't marry me?

303
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,420
We'll send him to marry the pillory

304
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:27,000
Scoundrel! Rogue! Woe to him if he comes before me

305
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:30,460
Yet you say he's rich...?

306
01:16:32,300 --> 01:16:39,440
Oh, perhaps riches are a privilege for those with wicked inclinations to become scoundrels

307
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:42,380
So, it's better to be poor?

308
01:16:43,180 --> 01:16:45,180
Certainly

309
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:48,280
Better to be miserable than wicked

310
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:55,480
Ah, if the devil brings him to me again, I don't know what I'll do with that unworthy

311
01:16:55,900 --> 01:16:57,900
S: There he is!
F: We'd better avoid the confrontation

312
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:05,890
Hey Filippo! Sandrina! Don't shut the door, listen!

313
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:10,260
What's the meaning of this fine courtesy?

314
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:14,480
They surely saw me and know the reason I'm tracking them down,

315
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:17,120
and yet they slam the door in my face like this

316
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,700
I want to know what's going on

317
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,600
Is no one answering?

318
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,600
Hey, anyone home?

319
01:17:30,980 --> 01:17:32,980
Really? By Bacchus!

320
01:17:32,980 --> 01:17:34,980
Hey, anyone home?

321
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,550
Chi è ?
Who is it?

322
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:42,700
It's me, Filippo. It's Nencio.
Open up, don't you recognize me?

323
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,940
Figures, were you deaf? [REVISIT]

324
01:17:45,900 --> 01:17:47,900
And what do you want?

325
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:50,060
Oh, really? What do I want?

326
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:53,500
I've done everything. I've found the notary

327
01:17:53,500 --> 01:18:01,000
I've invited the relatives and if you want, the wedding can be held tonight

328
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,000
You can go marry a galley

329
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,740
Rogue, scoundrel,
Accursed rascal!

330
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:12,400
Go to your wife,
Go feed your children

331
01:18:12,660 --> 01:18:14,000
Unworthy!

332
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:18,300
Get out of my sight, or taste this rod

333
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:42,000
You would marry Sandrina?

334
01:18:42,620 --> 01:18:47,720
Get that thought out of your head

335
01:18:47,720 --> 01:19:05,720
Either the gallows or the pillory, perhaps one day, will marry you

336
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:18,300
Never come before me again, true scum of scoundrels

337
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:29,160
Full of vices and sins

338
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:48,120
without love, nor charity

339
01:20:28,980 --> 01:20:34,980
You would marry Sandrina?

340
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:53,100
People are murmering,

341
01:20:53,260 --> 01:21:05,260
The miserable wife begs for mercy

342
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:13,160
The unfortunate abandoned has no aid,

343
01:21:13,620 --> 01:21:18,000
She has no bread

344
01:21:20,100 --> 01:21:31,100
Never come before me again, true scum of scoundrels

345
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:43,420
without love, nor charity

346
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:39,380
Countryman!

347
01:23:39,540 --> 01:23:40,740
Who is this?

348
01:23:42,260 --> 01:23:47,260
[Invented words]

349
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
No answer?

350
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:53,060
Sir, I don't understand

351
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:55,340
I speak 'Italiano'

352
01:23:55,900 --> 01:23:59,000
Yes, speak 'Christiano' and then I'll understand you

353
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,540
Where is my master?

354
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:02,650
And how would I know?

355
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:07,660
He come to marry [invented words] Filippo

356
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:11,240
I stop at [invented words] and not find

357
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,260
Can you teach me?

358
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:15,940
I don't understand even a single word

359
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:21,080
V: Ah, is he drunk?
N: Bravo! That's the way to put it

360
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,860
I had recognizing your face

361
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,940
From with me, we go back to the pub?

362
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,860
Yeah right, I have other intentions

363
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:33,440
Ah, scoundrel. Drank too much?

364
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:35,000
This fiasco is just what I needed

365
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,500
Take this [made-up words]

366
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:37,800
Sir don't inconvenience yourserlf

367
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:39,600
[made-up words] don't want

368
01:24:39,620 --> 01:24:40,900
What is this nonsense?

369
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,900
Me want, take bottle on head

370
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,700
Please dont; I'll drink

371
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:51,960
Ah, [made-up words] countryman

372
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:55,460
When master Sandrina have married,

373
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:59,960
want get drunk, want give [made-up words] in company,

374
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:03,160
want dance and be in joy

375
01:25:03,160 --> 01:25:07,000
What? Your master is to marry Sandrina?

376
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:10,520
Yes, pretty [made-up word]

377
01:25:11,260 --> 01:25:13,960
And the wedding is today?

378
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:16,920
[Made-up words]

379
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:30,500
[made-up words] joyfully

380
01:25:30,780 --> 01:25:32,780
That master today marry

381
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:50,000
You dance, you sing

382
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
I want get drunk

383
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:00,000
[made-up words] countryman

384
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:16,260
[made-up words] not pay anything

385
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,780
Everything is now clear to me

386
01:27:18,500 --> 01:27:21,800
Now I understand Filippo's departure

387
01:27:22,580 --> 01:27:24,580
He has found a better match

388
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:28,520
And to not appear as a turncoat or crazy,

389
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,000
he made up that excuse and harrasses me

390
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,800
But I will set things right

391
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,500
I no longer care about that foolish girl

392
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:45,420
For me, it's over, but I want to at least tell her bluntly my side of the story

393
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:48,180
To show her that I can sing as well

394
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:52,540
I don't care about that gossip

395
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,540
But I don't want to be painted as ridiculous

396
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:56,820
I want things to proceed orderly

397
01:27:57,100 --> 01:27:59,800
I don't want to be dominated

398
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:06,080
I'm not worried. There's no real danger in returning to argue with old men

399
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:10,240
But I want to talk. I want to vent

400
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:13,080
At least I will make him learn how to bargain

401
01:28:14,580 --> 01:28:16,580
Gentleman

402
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,300
Most Illustrious

403
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,500
What are you doing?

404
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,500
Nothing, sir

405
01:28:20,500 --> 01:28:24,000
What do you mean nothing? What do you seek from that house?

406
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,380
I was going to speak a word to Filippo

407
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:28,320
Do you know him?

408
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,320
Of course

409
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,900
And me?

410
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:34,000
I don't believe I've ever seen you before

411
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:40,500
Listen here, you clod, and you will know

412
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,840
I am the Marquis of Ripafratta,

413
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,000
who has fiefs, and marquisates, baronies, and principalities,

414
01:28:50,580 --> 01:28:52,580
and who, by the hundreds in nobility,

415
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:56,500
counts the quarters and measures them by the bushel

416
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,200
Ah, I believe it, Most Illustrious One

417
01:28:58,200 --> 01:28:59,100
That's not all

418
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:05,550
Know that in my service I have pages, and I have knights, lackys, stable boys, and black capes,

419
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:09,000
and a world full of beasts and persons,

420
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:14,320
And that if you ever dare approach this door again...

421
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,760
I will have you beaten to death under a cane

422
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:21,000
Ah Sir, please don't inconvenience yourself!

423
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Did you understand?

424
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,360
Ah, Most Illustrious, yes

425
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:24,720
Watch your back

426
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,720
Undoubtedly

427
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:31,200
But know that Filippo dealt me a nasty slight

428
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:33,200
What then?

429
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:38,180
Last night, just last night, he promised me Sandrina's hand

430
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:42,440
I came this morning to marry her as agreed,

431
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:45,000
And he chased me away, like a whipped dog

432
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,500
Ah, ah, you make me laugh

433
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:51,500
Eh, I know that Sandrina is getting married to you today

434
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,480
But I'd like to get even with him

435
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:55,500
With whom?

436
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,500
With that old man

437
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:02,680
And you think our marriage is all settled?

438
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,100
Oh, unfortunately, I know

439
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:17,000
Poor fool. Do you think I'd degrade my many titles, and such lofty and supreme nobility, to marry a mere peasant?

440
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,000
But a certain German servant of yours...

441
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
He believes it, and so does Filippo

442
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:33,300
In fact, for Sandrina I do feel love, so to give her great honor, I'll marry her to my kitchen boy

443
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,040
When drafting the contract, the names will be changed

444
01:30:38,040 --> 01:30:41,960
And one of my servants will step in for the marriage

445
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:45,700
And she will be a maid at my service

446
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:50,900
Oh, wonderful! But once Filippo finds out, what will he say?

447
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,560
What do you want him to say?

448
01:30:52,560 --> 01:31:00,560
Sandrina agrees, and once the contract is signed, there's no remedy, and what's done is done

449
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:02,560
He's going to look so foolish

450
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:07,480
Oh, how much I'd pay to be present at this wedding!

451
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:11,600
Come, you can serve as a witness

452
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,500
Ah, please do it, sir, for pity's sake!

453
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:15,800
Where do you live?

454
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:17,000
Over there

455
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Go there and wait

456
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:23,000
I'll send a servant to notify you

457
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:25,380
I'll go

458
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:44,960
Oh, what delight!

459
01:31:44,960 --> 01:32:11,000
If I get to see this old man foaming at the mouth, raging, fuming...

460
01:32:11,460 --> 01:32:19,520
The marchioness, the cook, when it's finally revealed...

461
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,520
What yelling, that ashen face

462
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:30,000
What will that old wizard do?

463
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:52,000
I believe I'll die of laughter, that I'll burst

464
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:25,240
Let's spread out this table cloth here

465
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:30,840
Here, a chair. Here another. A stool. One more here

466
01:38:31,180 --> 01:38:33,320
Alright

467
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:39,800
Oh my dear, you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth

468
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:41,800
Indeed, a great fortune!

469
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:47,100
Oh silly girl. Look at you! You're about to become a great lady

470
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:51,100
And lose the habit of working and staying healthy

471
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:55,100
Always traveling by carriage or by palanquin

472
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:59,700
When one has such good legs, it would feel like being in the pillory

473
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:04,460
Always dress in fine cloth and velvet

474
01:39:04,460 --> 01:39:06,460
And perhaps suffer more the cold

475
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,900
Have the pleasure of always wearing a pannier

476
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:17,440
Oh surely, the joy isn't small of banging one's shins in that contraption

477
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:22,000
Have many persons at your service

478
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,200
And let the public know all one's private business

479
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:32,000
Have not just a meal on the table every day - but a feast

480
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:37,800
A great invention, intended to erase one's appetite

645
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,900
Shut it silly girl, or else I'll hit you

646
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,800
But how do you expect me to adapt to becoming a great lady?

647
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:53,960
What? Do you believe you are the first? Oh my daughter, when fortune provides the rest,

648
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:58,000
arrogance and folly make their nest

649
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,000
But hush. I hear people

650
01:40:00,980 --> 01:40:07,320
Might it be the Marquis returning with the notary to draft the contract?

651
01:40:07,620 --> 01:40:12,600
Very soon, you'll see what a change of clothes can mean

652
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:20,240
Oh no! Give me simple bread and onions, and my dear Nanni

653
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:59,440
Pomp is a great deception

654
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:17,920
Per un'anima che disprezza il fasto, l'onor, e la ricchezza
For a soul that scorns ostentation, honor, and wealth

655
01:41:18,420 --> 01:42:14,840
I seek not, and I do not desire,
but the peace of my heart

656
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:44,000
I seek not, and I do not desire,
but the peace of my heart

657
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:09,090
At your most illustrious service

658
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:12,000
To whom do you speak?

659
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
With you, don't you see?

660
01:44:14,980 --> 01:44:20,000
My master has sent me here with the notary

661
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:24,320
to draft his marriage contract

662
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,320
And he told me to bring a witness

663
01:44:30,300 --> 01:44:32,620
Oh wonderful, how delightful!

664
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:35,520
And the Marquis?

665
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:38,240
Shouldn't he be present for this?

666
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:45,700
He will come to sign the contract

667
01:44:45,700 --> 01:45:00,000
He has now gone to make arrangements for the departure, the dresses for the bride, the ceremonial carriages, and everything besides

668
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:05,000
Ah, my dear daughter, what great fortune is this?

669
01:45:05,060 --> 01:45:14,320
Indeed, Mr. Notary, I would suggest you begin to write

670
01:45:14,740 --> 01:45:16,740
I'm ready

671
01:45:51,580 --> 01:46:10,760
In the year 1700, with a public instrument, those present and accepting, willing and consenting,

672
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:16,280
the following are to be wed

673
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:22,460
Who knows the names?

674
01:46:23,020 --> 01:46:28,000
The daughter's name is Sandra of Mugnone

675
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,140
And the master's name?

676
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:37,540
The servant will tell you

677
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,260
He's a Count, and he's a Baron

678
01:46:42,620 --> 01:46:45,820
He's a  Prince, and he's a Marquis

679
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:58,320
We shall soon see

680
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,500
What is the dowry?

681
01:47:08,500 --> 01:47:21,500
This is a poor girl, who has nothing and is marrying for charity

682
01:47:21,540 --> 01:47:23,540
Nothing as a dowry

683
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,100
nor as a trousseau

684
01:47:27,220 --> 01:47:33,620
So I believe
So it is known

685
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:39,480
Così promettono, così si sposano
Thusly they vow, thusly they wed
686
01:47:39,480 --> 01:47:44,400
not constraining and obligating themselves

687
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:49,050
This will suffice

688
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:51,860
Let them sign

689
01:47:51,980 --> 01:47:53,980
Where?

690
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:59,480
Right here the witnesses

691
01:47:59,540 --> 01:48:03,880
Here they are

692
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:06,580
Where is the Marquis?

693
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:09,060
Where is the groom?

694
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:18,920
He's arriving now
(It makes me laugh in truth)

695
01:48:19,940 --> 01:48:24,540
But when is he coming?

696
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:28,640
Here he is

697
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:31,860
This is my Nanni

698
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:33,980
This is Vespina

699
01:48:34,420 --> 01:48:38,000
Mi vien da ridere, in verità
It makes me laugh in truth

700
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:42,560
Che baronata! Che imbroglio è questo?
What a farce! What is this deception?

701
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:48,640
Thus infidelity is punished

702
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:52,400
I won't agree to any pact
I know well what I will do

703
01:48:52,740 --> 01:48:56,160
The contract is made and signed, it can no longer be undone

704
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:58,040
You are my wife
you are my husband

705
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,640
This is finished, and, as so, how it goes

706
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:03,280
Mister errant one, mister vagabond, leave here at once

707
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:07,640
Nobody has pity for me in the world

708
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:09,640
What will become of me?

709
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,300
Listen, scoundrel
710
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:14,300
You do me great wrong

711
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:16,420
The wife betrayed

712
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:18,040
A stale lie

713
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:19,800
The children abandoned

714
01:49:19,800 --> 01:49:21,560
Inventied slander

715
01:49:21,560 --> 01:49:25,560
Listen! Be quiet!

716
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:30,480
Now you will actually see what has happened

717
01:49:32,100 --> 01:49:40,700
I pretended to be the old woman who speaks in proverbs

718
01:49:41,060 --> 01:49:45,160
The German servant [invented words]

719
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:49,600
Enough, it was you, Vespina, with such an uncouth manner

720
01:49:49,600 --> 01:49:51,580
You knew how to trick us

721
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:53,580
Heaven give me patience
it's is an insolence

722
01:49:53,580 --> 01:49:57,280
But what does one do?

723
01:49:58,300 --> 01:50:03,700
What's done is done

724
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:15,520
So let us then be cheeful

725
01:50:15,660 --> 01:50:39,600
that in a double wedding today at least we will rejoice

726
01:50:47,980 --> 01:53:34,980
[Applause]

727
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:39,000
