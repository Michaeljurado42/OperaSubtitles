78
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Beautiful evening and gracious breezes

79
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,000
that erase from the day

80
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
excessive and great heat

81
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Blow even more calmly,

82
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
grant our wishes

83
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Cheer our hearts

84
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And sir, do we understand each other?

85
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes sir, everything understood.

86
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's no need to speak anymore.

87
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He leaves without saying goodbye...

88
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Where could my beloved be?

89
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm starting to suspect.

90
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Heaven conspires to my design.

91
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Beautiful prospect, I'm committed with good judgment to its triumph.

92
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Ah father, being such to me, you love me.

93
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Come on, tell me the rest for goodness sake.

94
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:31,000
It's my time.

95
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's my time and there's nothing more to be done.

96
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ah father, Ah father.

97
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Speak I beg you.

98
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,000
Now, my daughter, it's best to stay silent.

99
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Secret discussions dont always remain so.

100
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Do you understand, do you get my meaning?

101
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I dare not speak.

102
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Now, my daughter, it's best to stay silent, I dare not speak.

103
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
You get my meaning, I dare not speak.

104
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Truly, it would be a great incivility

105
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:44,000
to deprive you of comfort and freedom.

106
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Let's go, brother, let's go.

107
00:25:50,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Let's go sister, to dine for now.

108
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Each one keeps their agreement, everyone.

109
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,000
We may see each other with the passing of time.

110
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:15,000
We can happily converse among ourselves.

111
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Yes, daughter, in the end I've found you a husband.

112
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
And when?

113
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Now, the deal is concluded.

114
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
With Nanni?

115
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Oh, Nanni indeed! He can wipe that drool off his chin.

116
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This time, he won't get any.

117
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
But...

118
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,000
There aren't many 'buts', my daughter, Nanni is poor.

119
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
And I who am rich?

120
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You will be.

121
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
What does it matter if I'll be rich, if I won't be happy?

122
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,000
And why not?

123
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Because I love him.

124
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:00,400
You make me laugh. Now, you'll love this one.

125
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:06,400
But how can one love another, when one turns from their beloved?

126
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Easily, girls don't have a will of their own.

127
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,000
But when it comes from within, what can be done?

128
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,600
One obeys and stays silent.

129
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:24,200
But what should I do, if Nanni comes with such charm?

130
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Turn your back to him, and walk away.
