1
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,080
Good evening everyone, good evening, of course, to those who have come and have indeed come,

2
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,599
to those who are here tonight in large numbers, in this beautiful Maurice Fleuret space,

3
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:07,559
at the National Conservatory of Music and Dance of Paris.

4
00:01:07,559 --> 00:01:11,800
Tonight, it is the Department of Early Music, led by Pascal Bertin,

5
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,160
and also the Vocal Disciplines, led by Jean-Marc Demeuret,

6
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,879
that are being showcased.

7
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:20,919
A few words specifically about the Department of Early Music.

8
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:25,199
It is a department that benefits, of course, from the extreme quality of its professors,

9
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:29,000
who are all musicians recognized on the international stage.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,400
Moreover, each season, specific projects, like tonight,

11
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,519
involve prestigious guests.

12
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:41,760
Also noteworthy, the students have access to a magnificent collection of instruments.

13
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,080
What's also interesting in the philosophy of this department,

14
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,160
is the way it's never disconnected from the historical continuity.

15
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,199
I mean, this work on ancient instruments is constantly linked

16
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,639
with a reality that comes later in time.

17
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:00,879
Baroque is put into perspective, along with what is called the classical period

18
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,599
or the pre-romantic period.

19
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,279
Of course, this is the spirit of this program.

20
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:09,360
Tonight, this will also be the focus of my first question to our esteemed guest,

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,559
the violinist and conductor Sigiswald Kuijken.

22
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:16,639
Later, we will discuss other topics, more related to staging

23
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:21,240
with Marie Kuijken, after the Mozart Symphony that opens our program

24
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:26,440
and just before the Intermezzo by Haydn, 'La Canterina,' which will close it.

25
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:29,119
So, my first question to Sigiswald Kuijken.

26
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:34,039
Why have you chosen, in conjunction with Haydn's Intermezzo,

27
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:38,119
this early Symphony by Mozart, which is certainly not one of his most famous

28
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:38,919
or most played pieces?

29
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:42,880
It's a symphony from 1773.

30
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,479
Mozart was 17 years old.

31
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,759
He was still in Salzburg, but he had already traveled, notably to Italy.

32
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:51,199
Perhaps this is already a first clue to the explanation.

33
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:56,399
I think Mozart was a very likeable young man when he was 17 years old.

34
00:02:56,399 --> 00:03:04,520
Somewhat ahead of his time, he had already been influenced by many sources.

35
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,440
The first was his father, of course, who was not a great composer,

36
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
but who was a skilled tradesman.

37
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,360
After his travels, he benefited greatly.

38
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,639
He was accepted into the Academy in Bologna when he was around 14-15 years old,

39
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,320
which was quite exceptional.

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,759
So, this symphony, it's already composed by someone who knows his craft.

41
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,639
Why did I choose this symphony and not another?

42
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,119
Because, as you know, there are 41 symphonies by Mozart, right?

43
00:03:33,119 --> 00:03:36,559
It's because I wanted a piece with flutes.

44
00:03:36,559 --> 00:03:38,320
And you might ask why.

45
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,960
That's the pragmatism of musicians.

46
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,479
Indeed, and I believe it's necessary to think this way.

47
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:50,279
Because in 'La Canterina', which is, let's say, the main piece of our evening,

48
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:54,839
there are two flutists who play only in the first number.

49
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:58,199
After that, in those times, they were expected to,

50
00:03:58,199 --> 00:04:01,559
switch to oboe and even the English horn.

51
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:05,279
Now, it's not like that anymore, flutists no longer play the oboe.

52
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:10,199
So, the two flutists who play in the Haydn,

53
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,080
I preferred that they play something else as well.

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,359
So I found a Mozart symphony where there are flutes instead of oboes.

55
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,720
There aren't many of those.

56
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,799
And it gives a completely natural, completely different color.

57
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:27,160
It's in G major, but here the flute parts are placed, let's say,

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,920
a fifth higher than the normal oboe parts.

59
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,119
And that creates a different sonic spectrum.

60
00:04:34,119 --> 00:04:36,079
And I believe that's the only reason.

61
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:37,600
And it's a very lovely symphony.

62
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,959
So there's no hesitation.

63
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,320
When you, like you have been for years, delve into the repertoire of what's broadly known as ancient music,

64
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,079
you realize that many musicians like you encroach upon the classical and even romantic territories.

65
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,559
But how far can we go with this?

66
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:51,320
With this concept of historically informed music,

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,000
can we go almost up to our times?

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,760
To push it to the absurd, we could go up to last night.

69
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:02,640
One could even imagine playing Pierre Boulez's 'Le Marteau sans maître'

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,519
on an ancient instrument from the 1950s, right?

71
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:10,880
There, we're pushing into the absurd, and I myself am convinced,

72
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:17,760
personally, I do not say that everyone will think like me,

73
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,799
that the further we advance in the history of music,

74
00:05:20,799 --> 00:05:25,880
the less the use of so-called "correct" instruments

75
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,359
is really an absolute condition.

76
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,600
I think one should view this from a distance

77
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,760
and with a certain humor as well.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,559
I believe what's important is not to mix up the big picture,

79
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:43,959
I mean, the instruments used before the French Revolution.

80
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:46,000
It's something different than after,

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,640
but it's mainly the mentality of the musicians that has changed.

82
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,359
The Revolution was something significant.

83
00:05:52,359 --> 00:05:57,519
Maybe one day, we will... I don't know.

84
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,440
But it's something very strong

85
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,959
and thus the mentality of the instrumentalist changes

86
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:06,799
and also the instruments, the preferences for certain sounds,

87
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:10,320
the virtuosity, the overflowing expression, and all that,

88
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,600
it's typically post-Revolution.

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,720
Before, composers and musicians were more like craftsmen,

90
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,200
tradespeople.

91
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,440
Haydn had the rank of a valet at Esterházy.

92
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,600
– Even though he was Kapellmeister.

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,239
– Yes, but he never complained about it.

94
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:31,160
It's inscribed in another world.

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,200
Musicians were employees of this Mr. Kapellmeister

96
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,040
and of Prince Esterházy.

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,679
And that's normal.

98
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:46,160
So, we have a different education when we start from that place.

99
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,920
If later, we are children of the Revolution,

100
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:52,320
we will do individualistic things and will not let ourselves be dominated.

101
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,359
– A final question, Sigiswald.

102
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,959
We often use the term classical.

103
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,519
Classical music, for the general public,

104
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,320
encompasses all music from practically Monteverdi up to today.

105
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,119
The classical style, according to Charles Rosen, is much more specific.

106
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:11,720
It defines an era, a style, and even certain musical tools, compositionally speaking.

107
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,359
So, regarding this Mozart symphony we're about to hear,

108
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,119
we hear a sonata form in the first movement.

109
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:19,440
That's quite characteristic.

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,239
But in the last movement, there's a fugato.

111
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:24,679
This will come back later, as we well know, in Mozart's music.

112
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,600
But is this a remnant of the past, this fugato?

113
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,399
– I think it's both a remnant and also a sign of Mozart's curiosity,

114
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,399
who, being a member of the Academy in Bologna,

115
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:35,559
among other things, had to demonstrate that he was proficient in counterpoint,

116
00:07:35,559 --> 00:07:40,480
fugatos, things that were not really the language of the time in terms of gallantry,

117
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:45,839
but they were part of the past.

118
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,799
So, he proved that he mastered them, and increasingly afterwards,

119
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:56,959
in the quartet, you will see that he is very strong in that area.

120
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,320
And Beethoven, as well as Haydn – And then there will be Baron van Swieten, but that's another story.

121
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,839
– Exactly.

122
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,600
– We'll let you return to your instrument

123
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,160
and the musicians will take the stage

124
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,480
for Mozart's Symphony No. 27 in G Major,

125
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,000
K.199, of course,

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,720
performed by the ensemble of the Paris Conservatory under the direction of Sigiswald Kuijken.

127
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,280
So, Marie Kuijken, good evening.

128
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:34,280
We're going back a few years compared to this Mozart Symphony.

129
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,280
'La Canterina' is an intermezzo in music.

130
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,280
What exactly is an intermezzo?

131
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,280
Is it a kind of interlude intended to be inserted between two acts of a more serious opera?

132
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Yes, initially that's how it was.

133
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,280
It's a form that originated in the first half of the 18th century.

134
00:25:52,280 --> 00:26:02,280
In this idea, characters from the serious opera would take a more comedic pause.

135
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:06,280
In the second half, it evolved.

136
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:13,280
It's interesting to see that Haydn, on his manuscript, wrote "Interlude,"

137
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,280
but on the libretto, it's written "Opera buffa."

138
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:24,280
The two forms were already starting to blend and influence each other.

139
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:33,280
We're in 1766, the time when Haydn was appointed Kapellmeister at the Esterházy court.

140
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:38,280
What do we know today about the context, the way it was created there?

141
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,280
Do we have any documents? Do we know how it was staged?

142
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,280
Yes, there aren't specific documents about this opera,

143
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:53,280
but there are many general theatrical sources from that period that can be read and studied.

144
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,280
Some are quite general, others are very specific

145
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,280
and show exactly the rules of how one was supposed to behave on stage

146
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
and what was done and what was not.

147
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
It wasn't like today; it wasn't rigid.

148
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:07,280
There are two important aspects.

149
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:17,280
One is the visual aspect, which aimed to create as if there was always a living painting.

150
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:26,280
How to say? If at the opera you could do a freeze-frame, the action should always look beautiful.

151
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,280
And this is one aspect, so in the rules of how to carry oneself,

152
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,280
that we weren't slouching, for instance.

153
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:37,280
It was an offense to the king who might be in the audience listening

154
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,280
and who himself also had an education in how to comport and all that.

155
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,280
The king danced, etc.

156
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:50,280
Another important aspect is verisimilitude.

157
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:57,280
It means that the ideal, obviously these are ideals we try to reach,

158
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,280
we never completely achieve them, that's for sure.

159
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:07,280
But verisimilitude means that the action should appear real.

160
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,280
It isn't, obviously, because they are actors, they are singer-actors.

161
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,280
But how to make it seem real?

162
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,280
In the 18th century, they were well aware of how we function.

163
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:25,280
That is, if someone has a thought or a feeling, hears something, sees something, it starts there.

164
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,280
First, there's a reaction in the heart, in the eyes, in the face,

165
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:34,280
about what they think, what's happening, or the emotion that's coming.

166
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:40,280
First the eyes, which are the mirror of the soul.

167
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,280
From the eyes and face, it moves to the body, which makes a gesture

168
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:51,280
or moves or something like that.

169
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:57,280
And only after that, it goes into the voice, into the words, or into the singing.

170
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,280
And if we respect this, it was really in the sources,

171
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
we find a lot about this aspect.

172
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:09,280
If we respect this, we are good actors and the action will appear believable.

173
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,280
And then it's something very joyful because there's also parody involved.

174
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Absolutely, yes. In fact, a major part of the comedic aspect of this opera

175
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,280
is the parody of the "opera seria."

176
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,280
In fact, the opera seria was more static,

177
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:31,280
had more grand and more pathetic gestures, we would say today.

178
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:38,280
And the comic opera, the opera buffa, was livelier, faster,

179
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,280
and could mock the opera seria a bit.

180
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,280
That was an aspect that was done quite a lot.

181
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,280
Thank you for this staging and for these words just before,

182
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,280
so 'La Canterina' an intermezzo in music with Victoria Jung in the role of the singer,

183
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,280
Gasparina, Sahy Ratianarinaivo as the singing teacher Don Pelagio,

184
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:02,280
Makéda Monenet as the supposed mother Apollonia

185
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,280
and Juan Medina in the role of the merchant's son,

186
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,280
Don Ettore, and of course the ensemble of the Paris Conservatory,

187
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:13,280
conducted by Sigiswald Kuijken and staged by Marie Kuijken.

188
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:48,000
What a delicate little face
you have with this makeup!

189
00:31:48,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Blessed be the one who invented it!

190
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:47,880
Oh, see the difference there is between
the white of Madam Celia and this
given to me by the maid of Marchioness Impiastro

191
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,720
with this you can wash yourself, you can scrub your face, and it won’t come off

192
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:59,960
you saw last night at the theater, what a pretty figure the baker's wife made

193
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:08,420
and yet she has a color between green and black, it always seems she's been hit in the face with a bat and smacked

194
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,640
and that's what makes it look so beautiful

195
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:17,920
Here it is,
I've already said it

196
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:37,700
Blessed be he who invented it!

197
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:49,000
The ornament of theaters, the fifth element of us women!

198
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,360
They’re knocking, who could it be?

199
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,720
It must be the Master, now... Oh, Don Ettore!

200
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,680
What does this rude man want?

201
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:09,760
You tell him, that my father has threatened to whip me if I receive him at home

202
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,200
He has nothing more to give me, that's the problem

203
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:19,560
But, my blessed daughter, do you want to ruin us with your father?

204
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:25,160
He's back! We're locked in, we can't open up

205
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,800
Ah, madam! You treat me like this?

206
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,660
Kick out this madman with a stick!

207
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,660
Madam, why such disdain?

208
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,300
Break your neck!

209
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:46,120
Well then, this diamond circlet, which I took from my mother, I'll bring it as a gift to Angelina,

210
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,740
Diamonds? Oh well, who's out there?

211
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,440
Daughter, it's Don Ettore

212
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,650
Don Ettore?

213
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,720
Madam, at your service

214
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,700
My dear, it's been two months since I've seen you!

215
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,100
Daughter, what are you doing, if your father finds out?

216
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,400
What do I care, I want to love him to spite my father

217
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,300
Blessed girl, you know what you're doing

218
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,880
Is your mother well?

219
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:19,600
Yes, and see, this is hers; I took it and give it to you along with this cloth from Holland

220
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,700
But what if she notices?

221
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,880
She loves me, I'll tell her, and she'll keep quiet

222
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,840
Mother, see, what a beautiful, rich thing, this great lady's fabric, Don Ettore gave me!

223
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,080
Oh, what a beautiful thing! (It's worth three doubloons, the whole gift.)

224
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:40,160
Ah, poor girl!

225
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,840
She has no one who gives her a sigh,

226
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,240
with the hard work, we think about eating,

227
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,200
you see the life we lead, always closed in

228
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,800
I thought that the one who knocked just now was a merchant,
ho wants to give me a cloth dress to hear me sing

User
232
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,800
Credéa or ch'ha bussato, che fusse un mercante,
I thought that the one who knocked just now was a merchant,

229
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:04,120
I thought that the one who knocked just now was a merchant,
who wanted to give me a fabric dress to hear me sing

230
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,250
And why would you not accept it?

231
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,280
Who? What are you saying? To the house of Gasparina Zuffoli?

232
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,650
No one steps foot here; my daughter, she, who would ever believe it?

233
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,560
Easy, madam, I didn't say anything

234
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Now listen, Gasparina, I would have lunch with you this morning

235
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:33,800
Now listen, Gasparina, I would have lunch with you this morning

236
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,560
At your service! But we must hold back a little, until the lesson is over and the Master leaves

237
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,800
I serve you, my soul, but who is this Master?

238
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,320
Oh, he is an eccentric man, he would scold me right away

239
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,250
The girl knows him. Uh, the door, damn it!

240
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:50,080
A: The Master!
G: The Master!

241
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,320
Hide this sword! How will we spin it?

242
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,480
Damn, what pain!

243
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,920
Sir Master, I pay you my respects

244
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,040
So, two lire per palm? This man here is a seller of Dutch cloth,

245
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,020
he has brought us some fine stuff that I need, and he gives it away for nothing

246
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,780
What's the cost?

247
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,340
For three canes length, it's forty-eight lire

248
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,800
Nothing less?

249
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,780
What do I know?

250
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,040
Of course, if he has set a reasonable price, he cannot say more

251
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,500
Let's make it thirty lire!

252
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,520
My mother bought it for sixty

253
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,360
What? Oh wow! What is he saying?

254
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:49,800
The mother runs the business, he goes around selling. What a fool!

255
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,160
Come on, hurry up, this poor man!

256
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,400
Here it is!

257
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,500
Take it!

258
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,540
Nice trick!

259
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,320
Go, go down to the café! When the Master has left, I
will call you from the balcony

260
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,740
I salute you all

261
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,560
At your service

262
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:17,260
Come closer and listen to this aria that I wrote last night

263
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:23,800
see, it's in D major, with the horns coming in

264
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,060
and they strengthen with the mutes

265
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,820
Oh, this solo oboe exit!

266
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:46,720
Listen a bit! Recitative!

267
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:42,320
What should I ever do?

268
00:39:55,140 --> 00:40:09,980
Spouse…

269
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:13,480
will I see you lifeless?

270
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:25,840
And will you breathe out that soul?

271
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:34,440
And will you close those lights,

272
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:47,720
those sweet lights?

273
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,480
Go to the tyrant!

274
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:05,480
Oh, God! I, belonging to another and no longer yours?

275
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,250
What should I ever do?

276
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,350
Should I to marry the wicked tyrant?

277
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:19,960
Should I to behold my deceased spouse?

278
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:37,720
What will you do, my miserable heart?

279
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,000
What do you say?

280
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,320
Viva!

281
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,360
Bravo, signor Maestro!

282
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,880
Come on! Sing with me!

283
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,880
What should I ever do!

284
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,300
Spouse!

285
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,800
Softly, softly...

286
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:22,280
Will I see you bloodless?

287
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,240
Hold on...

288
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,560
Bloodless is like this...

289
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:31,320
Madam, go knit something! Don't interfere!

290
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:47,020
And will you breathe out that soul?

291
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,620
To breathe means open your mouth!

292
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,600
And will you breathe out that soul?

293
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,300
Witness this humiliation

294
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:57,320
Suffer her, Maestro. You know how she is!

295
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:10,960
And will you close those lights,
And will you close those lights,

296
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:37,720
those sweet lights!

297
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,280
Ah, those sweet lights!

298
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,520
Your sweet lights

299
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,000
"Yours" does not belong there

300
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:57,420
I'm talking about you!

301
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,760
It needs "Your lights" for more grace, don't you understand?

302
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:04,500
Here: "And will you close…"

303
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,920
That stinking mouth! Get that old chrone to leave!

304
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,640
Madam, a bit of chocolate!

305
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:16,280
Give me the key! "And will you close that soul,

306
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:19,280
And will you breathe out those lights?"

307
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,640
Long live the signor Maestro!

308
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,640
(Oh, may she break her neck)

309
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,200
How are you, miss?

310
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,640
At your service

311
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,000
I did not sleep all night

312
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,120
Because of the air?

313
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,700
Thinking of you, clever girl

314
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,160
Oh yes, I already believe you

315
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,060
Dear are those eyes

316
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:43,660
Oh, the lady mother!

317
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,480
Mr. Maestro, do you want to blind her?

318
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:52,600
“To close the lights” means the action of closing the eyes

319
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,000
What a great burden this mother of yours!

320
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,560
Oh, this is the problem; as soon as she realizes that I'm joking, she makes me tremble.

321
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,840
Every singer has this burden

322
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,680
(So the simpleton would have us believe)

323
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:16,260
Now I want to marry you,

324
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,660
What do you say? Speak!

325
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:25,680
Talk to the old lady about it!

326
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,300
Curse this triviality! Sempre con questa gnora!

327
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:34,000
I want to know if you hold others in your heart

328
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,900
Tell me the truth!

329
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:40,080
Ah, traitor! Is this how you treat me?

330
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,660
Uh, I would give you...

331
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,080
Ah, viper!

332
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:47,200
The old lady enters here again

333
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,500
Uh, she enters... !

334
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,960
What is it?

335
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,600
You watch yourself, another time!

336
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,700
What fault do I have? Those sudden entrances are difficult

337
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:03,720
It's true; This burden of these entrances, you have to put a stop to it.

338
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,300
Clever girl, how much you know!

339
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,200
Your student!

340
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,280
You have already won over the master, my dear daughter

341
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,480
Let's go, it's getting late

342
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,500
Are you leaving?

343
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:28,200
Yes, my dear daughter. (See, those glances!)

344
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,080
What a poor clod!

345
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,160
But you're going to wear him out with so much prudery

346
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,160
You who are in the trade, leave the burden to the master, understand me?

347
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:47,260
She speaks the truth. But isn't Don Ettore coming yet?

348
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,550
Come upstairs!... what a blockhead!

349
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,800
I certainly left it here

350
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,560
The Master has left
Come! What a fool!

351
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,720
He must have broken his neck, right. Haven't you seen him?

352
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,200
Have you one eye? Hurry up, it's already lunchtime

353
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,320
Devil, what do I hear!

354
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:14,620
Come on, hurry up the stairs
Come on, come on, poor animal!

355
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:22,000
Oh, rage! Oh, jealousy!
She goes on and on without shame;

356
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:27,990
May I forget all the notes,
May I lose my hearing and the beat,

357
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:30,440
If I don't get revenge on you

358
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,680
Let's hide here, let's see the end of his treachery;

359
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:44,400
After I've spent so much, given her a house and furniture, taught her music,

360
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:52,800
She deceives me like this? Ah, faithless women!
Hanged and quartered be he who believes in you!

361
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,200
You see, you must come to terms with it!

362
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,150
I have always been spying, but I've never seen him

363
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,550
Oh, come on!

364
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,960
I had to give way to the signor Maestro

365
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:11,720
Now I give way to you; Ah, such are human affairs

366
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,680
Bu why "give way" at all? You are crazy!

367
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:17,720
But why did you make me pretend to be a seller of these fabrics,

368
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,560
Having the Maestro pay for them?

369
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:23,360
It shows that he loves you, and you...

370
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,960
Ah, foolish! He owes me fifteen zecchini;

371
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,560
He had nothing to wear, so I try to settle it as best I can

372
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,120
Ah false, ah feigned, more false than falsetto itself!

373
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,480
But how much does he still owe?

374
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,480
Four zecchini

375
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,920
Don't press him for the rest

376
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,160
No, I want to pay

377
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,000
Tell me, madam, do I owe it?

378
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,680
Oh, ruin!

379
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,320
What are you doing?

380
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,080
Quiet, goat face! Take this,

381
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,760
Here is the money!

382
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,240
Quick to the table, now that you have arrived

383
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,920
Ah, my downfall has come!

384
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,720
Signor Maestro!

385
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:10,560
Signor cuckold, adieu!

386
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:32,720
Wicked, Deceiver, traitor

387
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:34,360
Don't shout!

388
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,040
For pity's sake!

389
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,560
My lord, kill her, for all she is worth

390
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:44,320
I want to shout from the balconies: These women, my lords,

391
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:51,720
Are false and assasins; let's just say they're singers, trust me!

392
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,320
What a disaster!

393
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:55,400
What misfortune!

394
00:53:55,700 --> 00:54:01,960
For the worry and fear I can barely stand

395
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:29,300
We throw ourselves at your feet

396
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:36,320
Lungi, lungi, gente ingrata, castigata hai da restar
Away from me, ungrateful people, you will be castigated

397
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:43,800
My fabric, my diamonds,
Tut! Those tears won't help,

398
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,080
Now I'll have you imprisoned

399
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,480
Ah, we are ruined!

400
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,880
What shall we do?

401
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,880
In doing it your way, I find myself reduced to this state

402
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:27,960
Had you listened to me, you wouldn't have run this risk

403
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,160
You should have broken your neck when you came into the house,

404
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,160
Ragged swindler!

405
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:38,960
Yes, fine lady, don't get me started

406
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,480
Speak, speak, so you may burst!

407
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:44,360
Good sir, please execute your duty with rigor

408
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,840
This house is my property,

409
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:00,120
These women must go away;

410
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,120
Hurry up, good sir!

411
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:10,500
What could this possibly mean?

412
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:13,440
Virtuous lady,

413
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,040
It means, you are to be evicted from this house

414
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:19,600
Which is mine, along with all the furniture,

415
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,840
That you compensate me for my monthly payments

416
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:28,800
And then go in peace, far from me, wherever you like

417
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,960
The jig is up

418
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,700
Its time to cut and run;

419
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,080
Now, let's take what's ours and go!

420
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,500
Imprison her, she's her mother

421
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,440
Me? I don't know her

422
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,480
Speak of it to her, even kill her, my gentlemen!

423
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,360
Evict, evict, out quickly!

424
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:51,390
Wait, what kind of treatment is this?

425
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:54,840
Let me first find another house to rent

426
01:05:54,840 --> 01:06:00,560
What house? Sir bailiff, if she doesn't leave willingly, you know what to do

427
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:03,760
Slow down, unworthy henchman;

428
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,920
Don't lay hands on a virtuous woman!

429
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,840
Virtuous about what?

430
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:11,920
Drag her away!

431
01:06:12,340 --> 01:06:15,520
Ah dear Don Pelagio! <Go, go!>

432
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,300
Pity!

433
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,240
I'm deaf

434
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:19,560
Oh God!

435
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:37,920
Oh, may my tears move you to pity!

436
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:01,850
There's no one to help me,

437
01:07:02,100 --> 01:07:10,960
There's no one who hears me

438
01:07:17,100 --> 01:07:23,760
Afflicted and sorrowful,

439
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:29,300
I have no more voice

440
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:50,120
Miserable girl! Where will she go?

441
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:53,880
If she had stayed just a little longer,

442
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,240
She would have already seen my tears come out

443
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,440
Truly, the punishment is too harsh;

444
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:07,160
But what worse does that ungrateful one deserve?

445
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:16,000
Come on, porters, bring these things into my house!

446
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:21,160
Piano, chè v'è della mia roba ch'ho restata
Careful, there's some of my stuff that I left in there

447
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,160
Like what?

448
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,880
A little box full of makeup,

449
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:29,880
A comb and a real mirror

450
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,600
You had left all this capital

451
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:37,600
Did you find it?

452
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,320
Here it is

453
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:50,620
Where are you going?

454
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:53,820
Desperate to throw myself into some ditch

455
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,360
(Poor girl! I can bear no more.)

456
01:10:56,920 --> 01:11:01,320
I know that I don't even deserve to be looked at by you,

457
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,280
I confess my fault,

458
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:09,200
But first, I humbly ask for your forgiveness,

459
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,300
Then I'll leave, farewell!

460
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:15,600
(Oh I might die.) Listen, daughter, I forgive you;

461
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,480
I give you the monthly payments,

462
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,000
And so it won't be said that I am so cruel,

463
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,440
you may stay in the house, until you find another arrangement

464
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,120
Oh heavens! This is a favor I do not deserve;

465
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,640
Oh, how good you are!

466
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,480
Let me at least kiss your hand

467
01:11:35,860 --> 01:11:38,040
No, no! (Now, what should I do?)

468
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,800
Wait, porter, leave her the bed as well;

469
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:45,240
Let my grace be extended today!

470
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:50,560
What do I hear! Ah, another kiss I want to press upon that hand

471
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,480
Hey there, porters, leave her the harpsichord as well;

472
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:01,760
Study and wait! See how good I am,

473
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:14,640
Forgetting so many of your faults: But pity is the trait of heroes

474
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:22,800
I see it, and am confused; Ah, another time let me kiss your hand!

475
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,120
Porters, slowly, slowly; leave her every thing!

476
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:33,000
What a generous soul! Ah, I want to throw myself at your feet

477
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,080
And never leave again

478
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:43,280
Porters, go into the house and bring all my things here!

479
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:50,300
But alas, I feel faint

480
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,480
What is it?

481
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:58,120
The great fear, the anger, the fasting...

482
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:25,200
Oh heavens, help!

483
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:35,200
Madam! Don Ettore!

484
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:43,960
Ah, poor thing,

485
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:46,960
How cold she is!

486
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:59,040
If only I had the carafe of lemon balm to revive her...

487
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,240
I am called here

488
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,600
I too am called here

489
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:34,320
Oh dear, I can't find it

490
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,280
But what do I see?

491
01:14:51,550 --> 01:14:55,360
Ah, my daughter has fainted!

492
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:09,080
Oh poor me, oh poor me!

493
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,760
Take this!

494
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:23,480
Take that!

495
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,320
Piano! <Adagio!>

496
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:29,350
Oh dear, this is the purse

497
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:40,760
What a good smell these diamonds have!

498
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:54,960
Oh good, she can smell it, poor thing,

499
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:57,240
She's out of her senses

500
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,720
Apollonia!

501
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,480
(Pretend well, my blessed daughter, It's part of the trade.)

502
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,160
Ah, poor daughter!

503
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,480
She's a bit of a vixen

504
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:21,760
Come on, show some spirit, my dear!

505
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:31,480
Awaken, my earthly goddess,

506
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:38,040
Your loving windows,

507
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:46,080
which without i am in the dark

508
01:16:46,900 --> 01:16:52,840
Ah, brighten those eyes,

509
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:59,160
Look around, dear daughter,

510
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:07,040
(Never let yourself be caught off guard!)

511
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:14,520
I don't understand, be it shame 
 Or rather feigned love;

512
01:17:14,520 --> 01:17:29,420
Enough, I don't want to trust

513
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:32,520
Ah, I feel restored,

514
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:36,040
I already find myself healed,

515
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:44,800
Gently. Alas, I faint again

516
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,680
This is a purse

517
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:48,400
It revives me

518
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,120
This is joy

519
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,920
What a scent

520
01:17:52,260 --> 01:18:08,720
it truly consoles me

521
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:21,150
This ring cheers the heart for its price, not the scent;

522
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:28,280
Too cunning is this one

523
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:40,760
It revives me, it truly consoles me

524
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:02,560
My beloved!

525
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:03,720
My dearest!

526
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:05,040
Dear, dear!

527
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,280
Darling, darling!

528
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,760
You're sweet, you're nice,

529
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,280
My dearest, dear!

530
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:16,280
Don Ettore: This ring is on its way, 
 Don Pelagio: I want to offer away my purse

531
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:26,280
I want to taste my destiny, 
 I'm prepared to triumph

532
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:01,880
Would you gift it to me?

533
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:06,520
I do not regret it

534
01:20:08,950 --> 01:20:10,860
This as a gift?

535
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:19,240
I present it to you

536
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:26,240
Long life to us, long life to the Maestro!

537
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:30,280
He no longer resembles a disaster

538
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:39,760
That can dismay us

539
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:59,800
If all of us can live

540
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:03,480
And join in joyous song

541
01:21:03,480 --> 01:21:13,400
We can remain happy together

542
01:23:54,500 --> 01:24:01,000
