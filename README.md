# License Information
Please insure that before you make each subtitle file, you carefully read the copyright and legal information regarding every production if available. If the creator of the production did not post the production online thenselves, it might have been posted illegally. 

If the subtitles are up here it either means
I either received explicit permission, have followed the guidlines layed out by the content creators, or the production is made freely available by the creators themselves pending permission. In short, please be mindful.

Also, please do not reproduce and then modify the subtitles. If you have edits, please submit them via a Pull Request and always credit OperaSubtitles when reproducing. That way we can continue to grow this project together!
